  "text.descriptions.city_berlin": "Berlin is the capital, and largest city in Germany - by both area and population. It's located in the North-Eastern part of Germany, on the banks of the river Spree.\n\nDue to its cultural diversity, it's one of the liveliest cities, with a famously intense nightlife. The population of each district is mixed, i.e. the infamous Bahnhof Zoo can be found very near to the city's central business centre.\n\nThe city was divided by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to1989.\n\nBerlin is a relatively safe city, however, one should really watch their bikes. Drug overdoses and drug-related issues are quite common, partially due to Berlin’s very intense nightlife. \n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to 3 districts: Rosenthal, Niederschönhausen, and Wilhelmsruh. These districts are located in the west part of the Pankow administration.\n\n[[3 748 148]]\n",
  "text.descriptions.city_madrid": "Madrid is the capital and the most populous city of Spain. It is considered one of the world's major global cities due to being influential in many areas such as the arts, politics, education, fashion, science and culture. Madrid is the home of Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid.\n\nIt is a very safe and tolerant city, as long as one stays very alert for pickpockets. Summers in Spain are really hot, so the risk of fire is really high.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to the Moncloa-Aravaca district - the third-largest in Madrid. It is the greenest district of Madrid, frequently visited by the students due to the close location of Ciudad Universitaria.\n\n[[6 661 949]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_moscow": "The gigantic city of Moscow is the capital of Russia, and is also the biggest city on the European continent. It is ranked the most expensive city as well. The Kremlin, Russia's site of power and the President's residence, is located in Moscow.\n\nThe most common criminal issue in Moscow is corruption. Besides that, the city is moderately safe during the days. The risk of getting beaten or robbed rises significantly during the nights. During the winter, the temperatures drop extremely low.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to 5 districts: Bibirevo, Severnoye Medvedkovo, Losinoostrovsky, Yuzhnoye Medvedkovo, and Babushkinsky. These districts are part of the North-Eastern Administrative Okrug - one of the twelve high-level territorial divisions that make up Moscow.\n\n[[12 506 468]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_istanbul": "Istanbul is Turkey's largest residential area, and also a transcontinental city in Eurasia. It lies on the both sides of the Bosphorus strait, which separates Europe and Asia. The European side is a commercial and cultural center, and the Asian side is mostly suburbs. It is one of the fastest developing cities in the world. Throughout history is has been known as Byzantium and Constantinople.\n\nThe level of crime is moderate. The biggest issue is corruption, yet thefts are quite common as well. \n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to Sultangazi, one of Istanbul's newest inner-city districts. The population of the neighborhood is a combination of many minorities, like Bulgarian, Turkish, Kurds, and Alevis and people from former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[15 067 724]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_london": "London is the capital city of England and the biggest city in the United Kingdom. It's located on the banks of the river Thames. London, founded by the Romans as the city of Londinium, has been a major settlement for over two millenia.\n \nLondon is not the safest of cities, mostly due to a high density of population. The most common crimes are thefts, muggings and drug dealing.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to Haringey - a bourough made up of strong contrasts. Areas in the west are among the most prosperous in the country, but in the east of the borough, some wards are classified as being among the one most deprived in the country. Even geographically: from the wooded high ground, the land falls sharply away to the flat, open low-lying land beside the River Lea in the east. The borough includes large areas of green space, which make up more than 25% of its total area.\n\n[[8 787 892]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_paris": "Paris, the capital of France, is the home of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. It's full of architectural and cultural gems.\n\nCrime in Paris is on a similar level as in most of big cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. However, there may be large demonstrations, which must be managed by a strong police presence. This can lead to confrontations and escalate into violence.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to 17th, 9th and 8th districts which are Batignolles-Monceau, Opéra, and Élysée. The districts are home for many artists, and are very popular among the tourists.\n\n[[2 140 526]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_rome": "Rome, is the capital of Italy, and is one of the most recognizable cities of the world. It is the seat of the European Olympic Committee. The most popular crimes are pickpocketing and bribery.\n\nHot, dry Mediterranean summers constitute a perfect weather for fires and other problems connected with heat. \n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to Municipio Roma IV. It is an industrial district called \"Tiburtina Valley\" which is the biggest production area in Rome, although it is currently subject to deindustrialization, and the old factories are being redeveloped into a shopping center.\n\n[[4 355 725]]",
  "text.descriptions.city_warsaw": "The capital city of Poland, Warsaw, is located on the banks of the Vistula river. The weather conditions are unpredictable and unstable, so the citizens need to be ready for extreme frosts, heat and storms.\n\nThe most common crimes are public drinking and vandalism. One is quite likely to get a beating on the East side of the river. Besides that, Warsaw is a relatively safe city.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be assigned to Mokotów. It is very varied district. There are many villas, old buildings, among the side with panel building. Mokotów is also known for its a cluster of office buildings, called  \"Mordor\".\n\n[[1 777 972]]",
